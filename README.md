This Arduino program utilizes the SoftwareSerial library to establish communication with a GSM module, enabling remote control of an LED using SMS commands. The setup involves configuring communication interfaces and pins, while the loop continuously checks for incoming messages. Upon receiving specific messages, like "LEDON" or "LEDOFF," the program triggers the LED accordingly and sends confirmation SMS. This lightweight and efficient code empowers users to remotely operate devices, demonstrating the intersection of IoT and communication technologies. Its clear structure facilitates easy adaptation and serves as a fundamental building block for more intricate home automation or remote control projects.
